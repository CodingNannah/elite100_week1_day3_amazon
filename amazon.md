#### I had trouble with mixing up the hierarchy of id and class attributes. I spent a lot of time fixing them, which significantly messed up the code I had already worked on.

##### I'm discovering that even when I think I create the right number of boxes, when I try to manipulate them, I inevitably need another nested one.

##### Trouble also with class="links" not working well for all elements. I had to get creative to force similarities, as well as the differences.

##### I researched the thin, horizontal line within HTML or CSS visible text, and I couldn't find it. I tried a couple of UTF-8 options, but they were either too short or too bold.

##### I still can't figure out what I'm doing wrong with the "form" element. I have two monitors of different sizes. When it centers for one, it doesn't center for the other.

##### I tried several different ways to create the logo. What I ended with, I could not figure out how to change the font style, size, and weight. What I was given is the default.

##### I nearly forgot these notes, and I did forget what to name them. I cannot seem to find the file in my class folder. 

*I forgot to constantly git this project after each successful piece. I created the successful pieces one section at a time, using <!----> and /* */ to hold places while I manipulated pieces.*

##### I was able to eliminate some <br> from my code. My goal is to eliminate them all.

##### I may still have some mixed methods (%, px, etc.) in this project.

##### Extras: I created the docs for the Terms and Privacy Links, linked them, and set them for download; created changeable link colors (pre, hover, click); created the help drop-down menu; updated verbiage.

##### I did not make it to fixing the Griot project, as I had planned.
